# Instant AI Cooker
This is my personal attempt at creating a Neural Network from scratch. It aims to be quick, lightweight, and easy to use.

# Usage
Currently I have yet to upload it to PyPI, but before that, the only way is to download the iac.py file, put it in your working directory, and do `import iac`. If you want, `from iac import *` can also work. Please note that it requires NumPy for matrix operations, and [my custom logging library](https://github.com/choc1024/log). To be honest, it is actually just a bunch of functions. See [here](WIKI.md) the ChatGPT-written wiki.
